This is a project for visualizing the behavior of 6-state 2-symbol Turing machines.

`input.txt` is the list of Turing machines to be visualized.

`visualize.exe` is the program.

Usage:

- A/D: prev/next Turing machine
- W/S: y scale
- Q/E: x scale
- N/M: view more/less TMs in the screen
- I/J/K/L/O: move (up/left/down/right/reset)
- 01,2,..,9: write current Turing machine and the number to `log.txt`
- mouse click: when viewing more than one TM, write current Turing machine to `log.txt` and remove it from the screen; when viewing one TM, show tape content
