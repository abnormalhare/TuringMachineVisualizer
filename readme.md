This is a project for visualizing the behavior of 6-state 2-symbol Turing machines.

`input.txt` is the list of Turing machines to be visualized.

`visualize.exe` is the program.

Usage:

- A/D: prev/next Turing machine
- W/S: scale
- I/J/K/L/O: move (up/left/down/right/reset)
- 01,2,..,9: write current Turing machine and the number to `log.txt`
